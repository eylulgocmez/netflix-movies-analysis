### DataCamp Project Tasks (1990s Focus)
The following analyses were completed as part of the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) Associate Data Scientist in Python track:
- **Duration Distribution**: Histogram showing movie length distribution in the 1990s
- **Short Action Movies**: Identified 7 action films under 90 minutes from the 1990s

### Extended Analysis (Self-Directed)
